Project Definition: Model-Driven Invoicing Form

Create a model-driven invoicing application that uses a predefined meta model
which defines the behavior of the invoice form in JSON (sample JSON meta model
attached). The application must dynamically create the form layout and elements
based on JSON meta model and must enforce data type and data validation rules in
the form editors. This means that the form editors and their validation would change
automatically when the meta model changes, e.g. when a new model property is
added or an existing property rules are changed The form must use Native HTML
components. For styling HTML components use CSS, let's try to make the
components look in the style of Bootsrap5
